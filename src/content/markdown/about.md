## ![icon](FaList) Work

### Credix [[link]](https://www.inthepocket.com/)

#### Senior Software Engineer <span class="date">Dec 2022 - Present</span>

### In The Pocket [[link]](https://www.inthepocket.com/)

#### Software Engineering Lead <span class="date">Mar 2021 - Dec 2022</span>

![icon](FaBookmark) As an Engineering Lead, I contributed to both technical projects and company-wide initiatives aimed at improving team collaboration and efficiency. A key project involved developing a backend system for a brand's IoT-enabled heat pumps and air conditioners, enabling data transmission from devices to an AWS backend with multiple adapter services and utilizing MongoDB for data storage. I also conducted load testing on this IoT backend to ensure stability under varying conditions.

![icon](FaBookmark) I implemented a shared pipelines approach to streamline CI/CD processes and ensure consistency across various microservices. Additionally, I supported engineers through regular check-ins, conducted interviews, and helped define clear engineering levels within the organization. I participated in a pre-sales track, proposing tailored technical solutions for a major client. Separately, I contributed to the development of the Colruyt Xtra app using React Native, enhancing the app's user experience.

### Nokia Bell Labs [[link]](https://www.bell-labs.com/)

#### Senior Software Engineer <span class="date">May 2020 - Feb 2021</span>

*Nokia Bell Labs is the world-renowned industrial research arm of Nokia, having invented many of the foundational technologies that underpin information and communications networks and all digital devices and systems.*

![icon](FaBookmark) I joined the team that created the [World Wide Streams](https://worldwidestreams.io/) platform. I mainly focused on the transition of this platform from research to a service offering. This included a rethinking of the architectural design of the platform and the rewrite and introduction of some (new) services. Examples include a new Gateway API with request validation, a new TypeScript CLI that communicates with this API, a shared logger library and an authentication service. I created an end to end pipeline shared across all components that enforces a standard way of versioning, testing and releasing. I also introduced sprint plannings to the team so the agreed roadmap could be delivered in time with small incremental steps.

### EnergyLab [[link]](https://sentiance.com/)

#### Freelance Software Engineer <span class="date">Apr 2020 - May 2020</span>

### Sentiance [[link]](https://sentiance.com/)

#### Senior Full-Stack Engineer <span class="date">Apr 2018 - Mar 2020</span>

*Sentiance is a data science company turning IOT sensor data into rich insights about people’s behavior and real-time context. Sentiance context intelligence enables solutions for lifestyle based insurance, contextual marketing & commerce, smart mobility, connected health, smart home, smart city and connected car.*

![icon](FaBookmark) I led a team of full stack engineers to create a new fandom centric social network. I was responsible for delivering a brand new mobile app (TypeScript, Redux, Apollo) and a public graphQL API (TypeScript, Koa, Apollo) backed by a Neo4j graph database. In both frontend and backend projects, we attained 100% code coverage and established a continuous CI/CD pipeline, delivering multiple automated deployments daily. This enabled our team to consistently support an ever-growing feature set (social login, friending, commenting, picture upload, notifications, ...). The project eventually resulted in a new spin-off company.

![icon](FaBookmark) I initiated a complete rewrite of the Sentiance demo app (Journeys) which embeds their proprietary tracking SDK. Therefore we bridged the native SDK's for android and iOS to React Native. We then created a brand new app (React Native, Redux, Redux Saga) and added animated interactive map views (Mapbox) together with custom animations and data visualisations, powered by a GraphQL API interface. I also created a CI/CD pipeline that automated distributing multiple flavors of their app (and sdk) while enforcing 98% test coverage.

### Small Town Heroes

*Small Town Heroes is a Ghent based startup that provides software tools and services for broadcaster and publishers with a focus on mobile video experiences and user interactions.*

![icon](FaBookmark) I was responsible for the design and implementation of scalable backend services, high traffic websites, API's and CMS interfaces for a variety of (live) TV shows. I took care of the full release cycle of the services - from concept to production releases - with an eye for quality, detail and user experience. My area of expertise essentially covered their complete technology stack ranging from architectural design to server deploys and UI tweaks. While continuously and actively learning I gained expert knowledge of and hands-on experience with Amazon Web Services, Node.js and its ecosystem, serverless architectures, RESTful dockerized web services, SQL and NoSQL data stores and a plethora of frontend development frameworks like backbone.js, react.js and react-native.

>Ilja & I built the Full Stack Engineering team at Sentiance. He was highly involved in hiring and mentoring engineers, introducing best practices, making sure our software standards were excellent, setting up software architecture, and successfully shipping several products. Ilja is exceptionally skilled in JavaScript, which allows him to apply this knowledge on multiple layers of software architecture. I can only conclude that Ilja is truly one of the best Full Stack Engineers I've ever worked with.

> Ilja is the canonical example of "Mens sana in corpore sano". He gracefully lived through the rough times of an early startup: designing scalable architecture, developing it and ... also running it. Over the years I've seen him evolve to a professional cloud native with a great hunger for new things but with enough pragmatism to deliver your product without the worries. Allrounder skilled in AWS, Mobile, Modern Web and data algorithms, I can only recommend him and envy you when you hire him.

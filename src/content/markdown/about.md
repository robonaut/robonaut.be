### Sentiance [[link]](https://sentiance.com/)
#### Senior Full-Stack Engineer <span class="date">Apr 2018 - March 2020</span>

*Sentiance is a data science company turning IOT sensor data into rich insights about people’s behavior and real-time context. Sentiance context intelligence enables solutions for lifestyle based insurance, contextual marketing & commerce, smart mobility, connected health, smart home, smart city and connected car.*

![icon](FaBookmark) I led a team of full stack engineers to create a new fandom centric social network. I was responsible for delivering a brand new mobile app (TypeScript, Redux, Apollo) and a public graphQL API (TypeScript, Koa, Apollo) backed by a Neo4j graph database. In both frontend and backend projects we attained 100% code coverage and a continuous CICD pipeline delivering multiple automated deploys every day. This way our team was consistently able to support an ever growing feature set (social login, friending, commenting, picture upload, notifications, ...). The project resulted in a new company [Aaqua](https://aaqua.live/).

![icon](FaBookmark) I initiated a complete rewrite of the Sentiance demo app (Journeys) which embeds their proprietary tracking SDK. Therefore we bridged the native SDK's for android and iOS to React Native. We then created a brand new app (React Native, Redux, Redux Saga) and added animated interactive map views (Mapbox) together with custom animations and data visualisations, powered by a GraphQL API interface. I also created a CI/CD pipeline that automated distributing multiple flavors of their app (and sdk) while enforcing 98% test coverage.

I took care of the full release cycle of the services - from concept to production releases - with an eye for quality, detail and user experience. My area of expertise essentially covered their complete technology stack ranging from architectural design to server deploys and UI tweaks. While continuously and actively learning I gained expert knowledge of and hands-on experience with Amazon Web Services, Node.js and its ecosystem, serverless architectures, RESTful dockerized web services, SQL and NoSQL data stores and a plethora of frontend development frameworks like backbone.js, react.js and react-native.

>Ilja & I built the Full Stack Engineering team at Sentiance. He was highly involved in hiring and mentoring engineers, introducing best practices, making sure our software standards were excellent, setting up software architecture, and successfully shipping several products. Ilja is exceptionally skilled in JavaScript, which allows him to apply this knowledge on multiple layers of software architecture. I can only conclude that Ilja is truly one of the best Full Stack Engineers I've ever worked with.

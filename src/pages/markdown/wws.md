## Description
>One Horizontal Platform supporting a Plethora of IoT and Video Applications

>A large-scale, geographically distributed, stream processing platform which can ingest, process and deliver large numbers of data and media streams in real-time between geographically distributed sources and sinks. Flexible chaining of pluggable analysis modules is possible, and new applications are authored centrally and distributed deployed on cloud, edge or device.

> Applications on top of the World Wide Streams platform consist of one or more continuous queries or flows. Flows are authored in a novel Bell Labs language that is called XStream. XStreamâ€™s built-in operators cover most of the common stream processing operators (e.g. map, alter, join, partition, etc). Additionally, it supports the declaration of external operators which are not implemented in XStream itself, but whose inputs and outputs can be directly wired up with other XStream operators. XStream has been developed as a library and embedded in TypeScript, a JavaScript dialect with optional static typing.
